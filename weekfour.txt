
    Create a basic markup structure for an HTML document.
It's about as basic as it gets.
    Add title (W4 Assignment: Web Pages), headings, text, background, some images, and other items using the elements discussed in the reading from our textbook.
Also done. Only one image cause I've got no clue what to put on this page.
    Analyze browser presentation of HTML documents on various browsers.
I used CSS to move stuff out from the sides, if that helps give it some style? Usually sites try to keep stuff out from there right?
    Use well formatted, easy-to-read, and commented code
I'd like to think it's well formatted, anyways. Not much needed commenting.
    Design a user-friendly interface, including readable output, with the interface being self-explaining.
The colors aren't eye-bleeding, and it's just some text and an image, which again is about as basic as it gets.
